                <td>Biotin</td>
                <td>Biotin, also known as vitamin B7, stimulates the production of keratin to increase follicle growth. You can find this vitamin in many foods, including

            <tr>
                <td>Vitamin A</td>
                <td>Hair cells are the fastest-growing part of the body. When your body absorbs vitamin A, it produces sebum. That's an oily substance that moisturizes your scalp, keeping it and your hair follicles healthy. Having a vitamin A deficiency could result in you experiencing hair loss. 
                    If you're looking to consume more vitamin A, you'll want to consume foods high in beta-carotene, which turns into vitamin A. Foods high in beta-carotene include sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrots, spinach and kale. You can also find it in cod liver oil, eggs, yogurt and milk.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vitamin C</td>
                <td>Your body possesses antioxidants that curtail free radicals' hair damage by balancing their electrons when you do. Along with balancing the scales, Vitamin C aids your body in producing collagen (prevents hair from graying prematurely) and absorbing iron which can help hair grow. 
                    You'll find vitamin C in citrus fruits, peppers, strawberries, tomatoes and guavas. Since your body doesn't produce it, you'll need to include these in your diet or have a supplement with vitamin C. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vitamin D</td>
                <td>Vitamin D deficiencies can lead to hair loss conditions like alopecia, female pattern hair loss and excessive shedding. You'll find these depletions more in people aged 65 and over. 
                    To get more vitamin D intake, you can incorporate fatty fish, cod liver oil, fortified foods (cereal, eggs, bread, yogurt) and mushrooms into your diet. Alternatively, you can catch some midday sun rays.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vitamin E</td>
                <td>Vitamin E contains the same antioxidant prowess as its vitamin C counterpart possesses.  It means it can curb oxidative stress by balancing out the electron level in free radicals. People more susceptible to vitamin E deficiencies include those with health conditions such as Crohn's or cystic fibrosis. 
                    Vitamin E is an effective method for treating hair loss. A small study revealed that people taking vitamin E supplements for eight months experienced a 34.5% increase in hair growth. You can also find vitamin E in sunflower seeds, spinach, avocados, and almonds.</td>
